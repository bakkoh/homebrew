Several witnesses say that they woke up in the night with one of these creatures crouching on their chest, intent on plugging the mouth and nose of the unfortunate with their hooked hands. In other cases, the appearance of a Bafardejo is followed by the disappearance of food, the escape of domestic or farm animals and, in the worst cases, the burning of houses. The Bafardejo seems to have a certain aversion, or a malignant predisposition, towards representatives of all religions. There are many cases in which the creature is caught interrupting and disturbing functions and rituals with obscene noises and desecrating mischief. The only ones who seem immune to the attentions of Bafardejo are newborns. There are even testimonies of parents who have seen the creature watch over their infant during the night, and cases in which the faeling has attacked babies are never heard, and the same for the houses in which they dwell.",

The creature is very adept at approaching and entering villages and dwellings without being seen, and even once the presence of a pest has been ascertained, flushing it out is no small feat. Ironically, a Bafardejo is more easily traceable in those conditions that should usually facilitate stealth. While inside an illuminated house it is almost invisible, the best place to spot a Bafardejo is the undergrowth through which it moves from settlement to settlement, and from home to home; the best time is when the clouds obscure the Moon, and everything becomes dark, and the faeling comes out into the open.",
